# Code and Math Classification Process and Results

Using the [code2seq](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq) and [code2class](https://github.com/noemiernst/code2class) models.

With Formulas extracted from StackExchange and converted into their SLT/OPT representations with [StackExchangeMathDataset](https://github.com/noemiernst/StackExchangeMathDataset).

And with Java Code from [code2seq](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq).

- See directory [results](results/) for the Results.
- See directory [code2class_experiments](code2class_experiments/) for the process using code2class.
- See directory [code2seq_vec_experiments](code2seq_vec_experiments/) for the process using code2seq and code2vec.
